### Building example page

Once you have the repository cloned run the following commands to get started:

```shell
npm install
gulp develop
```

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:9989` where you can see the
example page. It will also watch for any files changes and rebuild.
To update the compiled files in dist run `gulp build-dist-js`.
